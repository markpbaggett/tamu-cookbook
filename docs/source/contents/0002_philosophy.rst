About

When creating work and file types for the objects in our repository system, we adhere to several principles to ensure
semantic clarity, consistency, data validation, and interoperability.

This document describes these principles and aims to explain decisions and models found elsewhere.

our philosophy seeks to ensure that we are good linked data citizens by attempting to adhere to the
principles, standards, and best practices set forth of linked data described in documents such as `Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s Four Principles of Linked Data <https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`_,
`Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies <https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/>`_,
`How to Publish Linked Data on the Web <wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/>`_,
`Cool URIs for the Semantic Web <https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/>`_, and `RDF Schema <https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/>`_.
The philosophy also attempts to have a user centered approach to description and keep things as simple as possible
from a technical standpoint. Each principle is detailed below.
