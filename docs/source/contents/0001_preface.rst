Preface
=======

In order for us to add more complexity to our Fedora Works and IIIF models, we need good guiding documentation that
defines what we are doing and why we are doing it. This document attempts to not just suggest what a certain work should
look like as a Fedora object, but also explain why it should look that way. Similarly, it attempts to take a suggested
Fedora work type model and show how to display it in IIIF presenation 3.

The document is intended to inform on both the micro and macro level. The *Component* section describes the individual parts
that make up a work, their shape, and the reason for the shape.  The *Work Types* section describes what a more complex
digital object should look like and leverages the defined components to do that. The *Recipes* section describes a complex
scenario for a digital exhibit and explains how to make the recipe using ideas from *Componets* and *Work Types*. It also
shows these complex ideas using IIIF presentation and how it should be presented to the user and also mentions other
IIIF services that are needed to solve the use case.
