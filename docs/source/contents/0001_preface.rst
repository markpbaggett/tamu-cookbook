Preface
=======

In order for us to add more complexity to our Fedora Works and IIIF models, we need good guiding documentation that
defines what we are doing and why we are doing it. This document attempts to not just suggest what a certain work should
look like as a Fedora object, but also explain why it should look that way.

The document is intended to inform on both the micro and macro level. The Component section describes the individual parts
that make up a work, their shape, and the reason for the shape.  The Work Types section describes what a more complex
digital object should look like and leverages the defined components to do that.

The Recipes section leverages components and works documentation and explains how to model a specific idea or concept in
Fedora and present it back to the user.
