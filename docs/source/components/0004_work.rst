Work

The PCDM Works extension defines a subclass of :code:`pcdm:Object` called :code:`pcdmworks:Work`. A work is an
intellectual entity, such as a book, film, dissertation, etc that has member Objects representing their physical
structure (e.g., pages in a book or sections in a book), FileSets to maintain representations of the entire resource
(e.g. the OCR, HOCR, and Image for an Canvas), and TopRanges and Ranges representing their logical structure or
structures (e.g., sections and chapters in a book).

Minimum Model
-------------

A simple :code:`Work` may have many more properties, but should look something like this:

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
    @prefix pcdm: <http://pcdm.org/models#> .
    @prefix pcdmworks: <http://pcdm.org/works#> .
    @prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .

    ex:Work a pcdmworks:Work ;
        dc:title "An Example Image" ;
        dc:rights <http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/> ;
        dc:format "reformatted digital" ;
        dc:type "StillImage" ;
        dc:publisher "Texas A & M University. Libraries" ;
        pcdm:memberOf ex:Collection ;
        pcdm:hasMember ex:FileSet .

Rules and Guidelines
--------------------

A Work **MUST**:

* be an instance of :code:`pcdmworks:Work` via the :code:`rdf:type` property.
* be related to a parent Collection or Work via :code:`pcdm:memberOf` or :code:`pcdm:hasMember` to avoid orphanage.
* have mandatory descriptive elements as stated by `Metadata Guidelines for Digital Resources at Texas A&M University Libraries <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uN8FHSM8WrziIImwJ1ji6H3GxwGh4Cwe/view?usp=sharing>`_

A Work **SHOULD**:

* be related to a :code:`pcdmworks:FileSet` or other :code:`pcdm:Object` instance via :code:`pcdm:hasMember`.

A Proxy **MAY**:

* have other descriptive metadata properties.
* have many objects or filesets.
* have proxies if the canvases in the item are ordered.
* have ranges if the work has sections.
