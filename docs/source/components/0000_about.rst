About Components
================

Components are base resources that are used frequently in more complex work types.

Each component model includes: a definition, a simple example, and guidelines based on
`RFC-2119 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119>`_. When necessary, the component document
will also include a more complex document with a real world example.
